## What types of things do they ask us to build?
They may ask you to build various applications and features, including fetching data using APIs, to-do lists, forms, search and sorting functionality, e-commerce websites, infinite scroll functionality, comment engines, counter apps, and many more similar projects.
## What is the most challenging part of this interview?
The most difficult aspect is managing your time effectively and delivering a functional solution within the given time constraints. The pressure to complete the task while ensuring it meets the requirements and works correctly can be quite demanding.

ask interviewer to clarify Requirement, about Features{ shimmer, hamburger menu, etc }, tech stack allowed or stack preffered by you. mention tech stack you are picking and explain why you are using this, the thought process, the pros and cons


time: 10mins max
## Example by Building Youtube
planning first:

low level design: how would you use UI & data layer together,
and structuring your components.

	
	


code creation(execution):

use npx create-react-app for time management but when you are building big projects  you can create on react app from strach 

## Q: what is reportWebVitals?
When you create a React app using Create React App, it automatically sets up performance monitoring for your application. This includes collecting data on important metrics that impact user experience, such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

These metrics help developers and site owners understand how well their web application performs for real users in the wild. By analyzing this data, they can identify performance bottlenecks and make improvements to create a better user experience.
## Q: what is StrictMode in React?
When you wrap your application or a specific part of it with StrictMode, React performs additional checks and warnings to help you write better code. It is useful for finding and fixing certain kinds of bugs or problematic code that might not be immediately apparent.
